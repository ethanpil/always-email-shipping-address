Default behavior of WooCommerce is never to show a shipping adress in email notifications if the shipping cost is zero. This wont work when free delivery options are based on the local pickup method. Activating this plugin ensures that shipping addresses are always included in email notifications from WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Just install and activate this plugin and all WooCommerce order notifications will magically include shipping addresses. No options, no bells, no whistles. 

This code was shamelessly lifted from this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55479275/933782).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why don't I have any questions? =

There is no answer to this question. Maybe because this plugin just works.
